# General Midway Equalization #

Python implementation of general midway equalization for grayscale images.

Example runs using N={2,3,4} grayscale images avaliable in jypitor notebook

`general_midway_equalization.ipynb`

It is a requirement that all images have same dimensions.

## Intuitions behind the math ##



## How to run existing code ##

* Step 1: Open `general_midway_equalization.ipynb`.
* Step 2: Load N number grayscale images and make sure they all have same dimension. Stack them on top of each others either in a list or array.
* Step 3: Run codes from `utils/functions.py` and plot results.
 
 
 
Refer to `utils/functions.py` for detail implementation.

Try it out yourself, and if you have any question don't hesitates to create an issue. Cheers!
